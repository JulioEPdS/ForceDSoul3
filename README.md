# Hello world!! 
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julio Emmanuel PÃ©rez
I really like Arch linux, and I've been doing some cool stuff in the background from some time now,
but nothing impressive, I fell in love with documentation (reading it) thanks to archie, and with 
that I gave myself the oportunity to dive into some topics I never thought before, the major part 
of my free time was invested to Arch, to get things running, ricing, and trying out all the huge 
open-source alternatives that linux offers to us users.


## Ricing
You now, Arch gives a headache to whoever dares to just jump into it's nest whitout knowing anything,
the first experience comes with the _try-and-fail_ cicle that comes when installing, but after that, 
believe me, you start to develop some kind of super powers (_patience_).

First time, picked X11 and XMonad:
![this](https://github.com/JulioEPdS/JulioEPdS/tree/main/screenshots/HandsOnArchAndXMonad.png "my first rice") 
was my first successfull attempt to install Xserver to my Arch linux, I somehow choosed to start my
path using Haskell with XMonad, which wasn't easy at first and I never mastered, but was a great startup. 

## Homelabbing
Where do I start? It's the best thing that ever happened to me!!, I've used vms in the past like everyone
else for the uni, to have a glance at a diferent linux distro, to test services, but one day I came a cross 
a few personal needs at home, I started to doubt about the so called "privacy" companies provide, I saw an 
opportunity to test myself, to learn new things and _**build** >> **destroy** >> **rebuild**_, there are a lot of services that a modern home needs and use but using a provider right now, I want to have the power, homelabbing gave me that.
